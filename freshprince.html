		<center><h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1><center>

		<p><center>From western Philadelphia I hail
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green</p>
		<p>'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
		by ruffians contemptible and mean.
		Although the spat was trivial and brief,
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;</p>
		<p>and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
		I came upon a coachman most unique;</p>
		<p>and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
		I survey all the land with princely mien
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.<center></p>
